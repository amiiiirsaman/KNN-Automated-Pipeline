# KNN-Automated-Pipeline
In this project, we are developing an automative pipeline to receive an input, clean the dataset, remove the outliers, fill | remove the null values, scale the data, select the important features, and then run the KNN algorithm and find the optimized hyperparameters and predict the target value accordingly!
